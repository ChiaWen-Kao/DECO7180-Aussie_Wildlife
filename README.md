## Introduction
Aussie Wildlife is an educational initiative that uses game-based learning to bring the wonders of Australian wildlife closer to students, educators, and anyone interested in nature. Through a dynamic online platform, users can embark on a virtual journey through the diverse ecosystems of Australia, where they can discover, learn, and appreciate the beauty and significance of our native fauna.

## Purpose
Aussie Wildlife is dedicated to crafting an educational platform that transforms learning about Australian wildlife into an engaging and enlightening experience. Our primary goal is to cultivate a deep appreciation for Australia's vast biodiversity and underscore the pivotal role these creatures hold within their ecosystems.

Guided by this vision, our team has developed an interactive learning platform for children. Through an immersive RPG-style exploration, young learners can delve into the wonders of Australia's native fauna.

## Key Features

### <a name="uses-api"></a>Content sourced from real-time API
In the distribution map and specific regional animal photos, we utilize API data from ALA. In uses of API are the datasets employed in Aussie Wildlife. We've processed all the data to determine the most frequently observed locations in each state and highlighted them, allowing children to easily identify which parts of Australia have the highest observations of wild animals.

### RPG mode
Throughout the Aussie Wildlife website, we've designed it to resemble a role-playing game (RPG) to captivate children and boost their enthusiasm for learning. By integrating NPCs (Non-Playable Characters) on each page, we've introduced a storytelling feature that imparts knowledge about Australian native animals to children. To enhance this experience, the website offers the following functions:

**1. Read-out Function:** To address the readability concerns for our target audience, we've adapted our language to be more child-friendly. Moreover, feedback from previous user testing revealed that children are drawn to audio elements. Thus, the read-out function effectively heightens their engagement and interest.
**2. Outfit customization for the NPCs**

### Quiz
The primary objective of the learning process is to ensure children absorb the information and incorporate it into their knowledge base. Therefore, at the end of the website, there's a simple quiz to assess their understanding of the content presented earlier.
